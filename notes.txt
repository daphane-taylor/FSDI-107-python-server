whats a API? 
    an interface.

Why do we use API's?
    to help someone get access to a server we create an interface with a set of rules to follow to be able to access the needed server


@app.get("/")

name of server = app
get request = .get
page being requested = ("/")
root/homepage = / inside of the ()

@app.get("/test")
def test():
return "Hello from the test page"
